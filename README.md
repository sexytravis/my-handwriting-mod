# my-handwriting-mod
Have you ever wanted to make the default font in Sub Rosa so illegible that it makes the game even harder? 
Well, this is the mod for you!
With this mod, you can: 

- Not read anything
- Make people who use text to chat barely understandable
- Make all the text in the menu look like shit



HOW TO DOWNLOAD

- To download this mod, go to Sub Rosa/font, and then replace rockwell.png with the other rockwell.png I have provided. 
- If you don't like this mod, you can go into the backup folder of this mod to download the original version of rockwell.png.
